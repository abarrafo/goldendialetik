      <p><i>"Mine is a gentle, fragile philosophy like a delicate flower; my theory must be nourished, the wilted petals cropped to let the stronger, more vibrant flower within to blossom.  Not being a philosopher there are innumerable flows in the details of my thoughts, but its the overall view of the orchid that we are after."  (Barraford, Unpublished papers, original date of composition unknown, possibly circa 1985)</i></p>
      <p>At the heart of the Golden Dialetik there is the dialectic, but everything is relativistic; causality being relative to the associated acausality of an instance, whether it be an object or situation.  As the scope of the relative reality expands, the world as we know it emerges.  At the point where humanity comfortably resides, a single human would be upon his or her own causal path, and from this individualistic level, a personal dialetik is born, and beyond this level others arise.</p>
      <p><i>"Like rivers running to the sea, the dialetik becomes part of a Dialetik, which in turn is part of the Golden Dialetik." (The Golden Dialetik, 2014, p.24)</i></p>
      <p>There are three initial avenues to explore when looking into the Golden Dialetik:  (1) observing the vision of this new dialectical structure in everyday reality, (2) understanding the various relativistic levels, dialectical, dialetik, Dialetik to the Golden Dialetik, and coming to the understanding that the Golden Dialetik is a separate reality, which humanity can and does engage.</p>
      <p>As discussed in The Golden Dialetik, as opposed to the religious conception of a onetime creation, the dialectical process presents reality as being created constantly.  Let us take an example: a yellow daisy.  On your travels you spy a field full of daisies.   Next, you find the most beautiful daisy in the field, dew dripping off it.  You traverse down to the molecular, then to the atomic level.  In among this atomically dissected flower there is one atom you fix your attention on, and watch as other atoms swarm around you.   You are this atom for this moment and become aware of all the other atoms in your neighborhood.  As a single atom, you have a past back to the beginning of time and, assuming some sentience, can envision a future, but in the present you are a single atom with other atoms in a mist about you, a flower.</p>

      <p>In this imagery, you are causality, and the cloud of atoms around you are caught in an acausal stasis outside of time. When you look at yourself, you are the atom, but when you look beyond the causal path and become aware of all the other atoms in the nearby vicinity, this is when you can understand that you are part of something larger through understanding acausality.</p>
      <p>An analogy is the history of our knowledge of the Milky Way.   The Greek’s explanation for the Milky Way was a myth based on Heracles (Hercules) as a baby suckling his sleeping step-mother’s breast (Hera) at Zeus’s insistence.  When his step-mother awoke and pushed him away, milk spurt from her breast, creating the Milky Way.   The Greek’s created an explanation of the creation of the Milky Way, but as humanity spread its knowledge further and further into the Universe, this “Milky Way” transformed into a band of stars to become the Milky Way Galaxy.  Humankind explored multiple causal paths and were able to see the connections between the many paths to realize an acausal vision of a galaxy made up of stars.</p> 
      <p>Extending our original analogy of the yellow flower, when the scope is expanded the vision of the flower changes.  The further we explore the universe, the enormous or infinitesimal, the more humanity sees the bigger picture and finds their true context, from which a greater picture can be derived, as we become like the atom in the flower that can now see that it is part of a daisy, and beyond that boundary as our scope expands there explodes before us a field of daisies.</p>

      <p></p><br>
      <p></p>
      <p>Another vision of this reality comes from The Book of the Joyful Way:</p>
       <p></p>
       <h4>Snapshot of a Waterfall</h4>

       <p><i>"Attempting to envision the One requires first attempting to envision a moment,<br>
Seeing a snapshot of the whole is like envisioning the water in Niagara Falls.<br>
Each molecule of water flowing over the falls has a causal path back to creation,<br>
But each molecule is separate, but flowing in proximity together with others;<br>
One molecule to countless molecules, a vast volume of water into a vast chasm.<br>
When you look at a majestic waterfall, you glimpse the awesome immensity,<br>
Stretching from the miniscule to the enormous, acausality links by not linking.<br>
This crystallized vision gleams in the sunlight as a person chooses to remember,<br>
Creating a crystal choice of light and liquid, and water thundering over the brink.<br>
Then in a millisecond the snapshot shatters as the molecule of water is replaced<br>
By another molecule of water and the accompanying acausal molecules swapped<br>
For a new set of water molecules flowing together over the edge into the abyss.<br>
Then millisecond after millisecond after millisecond thy crystal vision lapses<br>
Into a remembrance that no longer accurately reflects the exact waterfall,<br>
But provides just an approximation of the amazing vastness behind the Dialetik.<br>
To see this waterfall again, one must see beyond this approximation once more,<br>
To experience the Tao one must abandon the crystal choice once chosen <br>
To choose once again, and again, and again, and again, and again, ad infinitum."<br>
(The Book of the Joyful Way, 2016, p.110)<br></i></p>
   <p></p>
   <p>Like the atom in the daisy, in this view of reality you track a single molecule (H<sub>2</sub>0), but then you become aware of the context of that molecule to survey the whole waterfall.  The broader implications of this excerpt is that reality is a waterfall cascading around you.  Although everything may look still, each object you perceive is at the peak of its own waterfall of creation.   Whether rock or tree or sky or cloud, everything flows by you at their own pace.</p>
   <p>This study of reality brings up the scope of the dialectical process.    Existent on the molecular level or the astronomic, there are various levels of practical application.  The dialectical structure expands exponentially, depending upon the point of origin.   Let us say that YOU are the point of origin for this next study.  From your personal perspective, there are four levels of reality:</p>
   <i>
   •	"dialectic – a thesis/antithesis/synthesis event happening in the present<br>
   •	dialetik – a single dialectical thread extending into the past, present and future <br>
   •	Dialetik – a group of dialetikal processes in relative proximity, creating a reality within a relative spacetime <br>
   •	Golden Dialetik – All Dialetiks of the universe, in other words, Everything"    (The Golden Dialetik, 2014, p.7)<br>
   </i>
   <p></p>
<p>We have already explored the present of a single dialectical instance (atom in a daisy, molecule in a waterfall), this structure is precise, limited to the present or near present), but from this single molecule explodes forth trillions more elements present within the same instance.  Observing this single molecule is causality, while the trillions more represent acausality. 
<p><i>"A single dialectical thread (or dialetik) represents a chain of syntheses going back (or forward) in time infinitely."  (The Golden Dialetik, 2014, p.24)</i></p>
<p>The metamorphosis from dialectic to dialetik or "dialectical thread" is the expanded awareness of the causal path of the causal instance under consideration.</p>
<p><i>"A “dialectic” is a thesis/antithesis/synthesis event, happening in the “here and now,” but when understood to be part of a larger system, a dialectic can be viewed as a snippet taken from a thread of dialectical events.  From synthesis to thesis throughout time immemorial, this single dialectical thread represents a “dialetik.”   An example of a “dialectical thread” or dialetik, could be particles in an oxygen atom tracked back through the atom’s creation in a star and even further back through the eons to the 'Big Bang.'”  (The Golden Dialetik, 2014, p.7)</i></p>
<p>About every human there is an uncountable collection of dialetiks, including you.</p>
<p><i>"The Dialetik represents all the dialetikal threads in a relative locale, such as your personal cosmos.  As you sit at the edge of the ocean and ponder your past or the universe, you are at the nexus of your own Dialetik. The Golden Dialetik embodies all the Dialetikal threads in reality, everything."  (The Golden Dialetik, 2014, p.7-8)</i></p>
<p>When we view the whole golden flower, the daisy, we are experiencing a new level, which is called the Dialetik.  Taking that droplet of dew, there are many sextillion water molecules at their dialectical peak that condense into the small droplet that you see, as you are “seeing” acausally, but experiencing causally, when you touch the drop.  </p>
<p>Expanding your field of vision to encompass acausality opens up a virtually infinite number of atoms that your senses can take in.  When you can see into the magnificence of a dewdrop, you are experiencing a Dialetik, the next relativistic level.  This example employs human cognition as a center point, but you can take humanity out of this equation, since most of all animals have these same cognitive capabilities, and still arrive at the Dialetikal level, normal reality that we share with the rest of living creatures.  </p>
<p>The standard definition of “center” is that there is a mid-point in reality of an object that one is observing; this is a causal definition.  Ironically, acausality has a different definition: Everything has its own center.  (“E” is purposely capitalized to be all inclusive.)</p>
<p><i>"Paradoxically, this Dialetik creates everything, but never changes.  This is a dynamic process, which is in progress even as you read this line, creating your immediate reality.  You are at the middle of a universe that was created, but is also being created around you.   This combined vision of interminable dialectics of causal and acausal components creates the green grass you are lying on, the blue sky above you and the white clouds floating by." (The Book of the Joyful Way, 2016, p.18)</i></p>
<p>At one point, all these Dialetikal levels merge, creating the reality that we know, the Golden Dialetik.  As you are out in the nearest meadow (or open ocean), you can see but a fraction of this reality, but there is another aspect to the Golden Dialetik.   Behind each and every reality is a limitless number of dialetiks and, subsequently, each dialetik has at its center a dialectical process. There is a parallel dialetikal reality beyond reality, the metaphysical reality of the dialectic:</p>
<p><i>"One aspect of the Golden Dialetik that needs to be broached is the elegant realization that the Golden Dialetik never changes, but the results of all the cycles of the Golden Dialetik create an infinite reality.  The basic dialectical process is the same whether it is taken out of context or part of the creation of the universe; the dynamic is between a thesis, antithesis and synthesis.  Infinitely applied, the results of this cycle are infinitely variable." (The Golden Dialetik, 2014, p.28)</i></p>
<p>This alternate reality can be and has been observed.  Great minds of the past have reported their experiences:  Lao Tzu, Moses, Muhammad, Jesus Christ, Buddha, Hesiod, anonymously, as through the great journals of India, etc.  This list can go on quite some time.  I call the results of these engagements Crystal Choices, which are snapshots of the Golden Dialetik that in essence describe unifying theories of the Universe.</p>
<p>Both of these concepts, Crystal Choices and Unifying Theories of the Universe, will be taken up in other pages, but the final point is that the Dialetik (and the Golden Dialetik) can be viewed as a parallel reality that has been experienced by humanity.  An example would be Lao Tzu of <i>Tao Te Ching</i> fame:</p>
<p><i>"In regards to Lao Tzu, he perceives the Golden Dialetik…  Lao Tzu describes the Tao (Golden Dialetik) with an amazing clarity through the words of his cultural prism." (The Golden Dialetik, 2014, p.133)</i></p>

            <p></p>
     <p>Deciding to have some fun, I worked at a mathematical formula that one could theoretically say describes the Golden Dialetik:
     </p>
     <p>S (α , Ω) = (T(α) + A(Ω))<sup>∞</sup></p>
               <p></p>
         <p>S = Synthesis<br>
         T = Thesis<br>
         A = Antithesis<br></p>
         <p></p>
         <p>α = 0 (zero) to many (infinite)<br>
         Ω = 0 (zero) to many (infinite)</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>I have come up with an alternative formula, which I am debating if it is more appropriate.  Since per the 2<sup>nd</sup> axiom that our universe is not perfect, may the original use of the "=" (equal sign) signifies too much perfection and the approximate sign ("≈") makes more sense.</p>
      <p>S (α , Ω) ≈ (T(α) + A(Ω))<sup>∞</sup></p>
      <p></p>
     <p>Please accept this in the light hearted fashion it was given.</p>
