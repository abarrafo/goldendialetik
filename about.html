              <h4><i>The Golden Dialetik</i> (2014, p.191-196)</h4>
              <h5>Epilogue</h5>
<p>I am like a child…</p>
              <p><i>"I have been told I have the countenance of a child, but when one looks within, I have the depths of an old man.”  (Barraford, Unpublished Papers, circa 1920)</i></p>
              <p>My perspective has been child-like and at times I could be perceived as terminally superficial.  I have covered “Everything” in a few hundred pages, so I have no choice being so, but then again, I have constantly been chastised for my naive approach to people and reality.  Everything is new to me and experiencing every new day is awesome.</p>
<p>This uncomplicated approach is a strength and a weakness.  At times I have been superficial and I am sure someone will criticize many tracts in this book, but to pull together a unified theory of the universe requires bending some thoughts and merging ideas.  The pieces out there are fragments with years of accreted knowledge, so the pieces no longer fit together due to the distorting verdigris.  The patina can obscure the underlying form.  Removing this accumulated crust and fitting the pieces together in a universal jig-saw puzzle is a courageous act, and not one done by a savvy individual.</p>
<p>Like Walt Whitman’s Leaves of Grass, this book will never be finished, but will be added to and edited as long as I am able.   I intend to be working on this book until the day I die, and even then I will never conclude that it is perfect, since by dialetikal definition, perfection is impossible for mere mortals.   Throughout this extended writing process, I hope to maintain my child-like awe of the universe.</p>
<p>With this expectation of imperfection, I anticipate inconsistencies, but if one adheres to the concept of perpetually correcting errors, eventually a modicum approaching perfection may be possible, eventually.  I expect a lot of corrections.  So, instead of a “conclusion”, I am providing this epilogue with some thoughts and anecdotes.</p>
<p>The forerunner to this book, The Golden Sphere, was begun in the early 80s, when I took my  in the dungeon of my father’s basement, after my return to the realm of the working, I completed the initial draft of my precursor volume.  Over the next two years (1987-1989), I rewrote the book, completing what I could and self-published the tome during a time when self-publishing was a real effort.  Like Henry David Thoreau, I had one of the larger personal libraries in my area, but they were all my own books.</p>
<p>During this “rewrite” phase, I again engaged the Golden Dialetik at a very serious level.  At night I couldn’t sleep as the Golden Dialetik was blazing a golden path across my brain.  If even a modicum of success had happened at this stage, I would have lost my perspective on the Golden Dialetik, and this book would never have happened.  In hindsight I realize that I was not ready.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the book itself was unfinished, notwithstanding the fact that it was printed in 1990.  Picking it up later, it was like reading someone else’s work, but in the end I did follow what I was attempting to do, realizing that I was trying to do too much.  I had delusions of grandeur.   I still have delusions of grandeur that I battle, but I am getting to an age where the threat of recognition means much less to me.   (Illusion/delusion is something that is very difficult to avoid when working in this area.)</p>
<p>Additionally, there were parts of the concept, which I had not worked out and which would take me an additional twenty-five years of thinking, so even if I had achieved notoriety at the time, I was on thin ice in terms of understanding what I was talking about.   (I am sure some would say that I crashed through the ice some time ago.)  Years passed and my thoughts in this area subsided, including my initial bursts of energy and enthusiasm accompanying my personal experiences with the Golden Dialetik.</p>
<p>That brings me to this book, which I wrote primarily in my home in Amherst, NH.  As the end of my working days approached, I was looking into what really mattered for me.  Not unusually, I was looking into what I needed to complete before I passed on (some would call it the bucket list), and this rose to prominence.   I have no illusions.  As many of my previous books, this book has no commercial value, and I am expecting a small printing.</p>family on an extended visit to Cullera, Spain, which is just south of Valencia.  At the time, there was a robust charter flight system going to Paris, France, so we traveled to Paris, stayed over with my wife’s sister’s family and then took the night train to Valencia.  I remember arriving into the Valencia train station and being entranced with the molded oranges and foliage adorning this edifice.  This was quite an adventure for a young family.</p>
<p>In Cullera, I was ensconced in a small apartment (thankfully, I could fit in my young family) with a light blue vinyl screen, and worked on the forerunner of this book, The Golden Sphere, while enjoying the “buena vista” that the apartment afforded with some equanimity.  I had a small desk and a cubby-hole of space, illuminated by a blue haze from the sunshade.  I was able to work on this strange book about dialectical structures, while pondering the blue sky, the river and the orange groves that riddled the plain before me.   Under these conditions in Spain, I personally engaged the Golden Dialetik for the first time.<p>
<p>The book was unfinished when I was forced to return to the United States.  In Sherborn, Massachusetts
<p>With these less than spectacular expectations, should I be worrying about the inconsistencies, the fatal flaws?   What difference does it really make?  In the end these books (The Golden Sphere and The Golden Dialetik) have no traditional marketable future, and flaws or no flaws, the trend of non-existent sales is expected to continue, yet both books mark the end of phases of my personal journey and act like printed time capsules, which I can send out to libraries for the sake of posterity.  If by chance I achieve a little notoriety, I can put out a second edition with many corrections, so flaws be damned; it is time for these thoughts to come out.</p>
<p>Maybe someday, someone will think that I make sense.  Maybe, to my great surprise, someone will understand and appreciate what I have written.   Maybe, someone will stumble across this little volume and find some guidance, clarity and maybe even solace in the fact that they are not alone, because we are all together in learning the unknowable.</p>

              <h5>Credentials</h5>
              <p><i>"The wise man realizes that you do not reach for greatness,<br>
                      But if one follows the pursuit of the One, greatness will come to you."<br>
                      The Book of the Joyful Way, Chapter 74 (63), p. 123)
                  </i></p>
              <p></p>
              <p>During an editorial review, the editor kept harping on demonstrating my credentials.  The more I learn about the Golden Dialetik and the deeper I traverse into moderation, I find a level of humility, which cannot bear speaking about how credible I am.  I will further admit that I do not speak or write any form of Chinese, Sanskrit or Hebrew, further undermining my credibility.  I am not a scholar or a scientist.</p>
<p>Attempting to extoll my virtues has always been painful for me, whereas honestly stating my imperfections feels right, although most people tell me this is wrong.</p>
<p>In the light of the Golden Dialetik, all men and women are without credentials.  A fisherman or a tenured professor with multiple PhDs stand within the same light and enjoy the same wisdom, or equally they may not.  Truths, whether simply stated or annotated with 50 references, remain the same truths.</p>
<p>Maybe I am wise; maybe I am foolish.  That is up to you to decide.  So, clearly I state that I have no credentials, holding true to the views in my books, and therefore in the eyes of the world I have no credibility.  I am not looking for followers, or believers in my concepts.  My words are no more the words from God than yours are.</p> 
<p>I am not interested in demonstrating to people how much I believe in myself, but I am looking to help people believe more in themselves.  I am not looking for followers, but I am looking for people who want to lead their own lives, and for followers who want to stop following.</p>
<p>If you are a scientist, I am hoping to provide you with a bridge to logically conclude that God can exist without feeling you are taking a leap of logic to do so.  For people that believe in God or Yahweh or Allah, God will no longer be an act of belief, but a reality that you can behold.</p>
<p>I have no credentials, but what I am trying to do is not done enough.  Regardless of my success or failure, bringing these theories and their related thoughts to light, can only be a positive.  I hope that you will join with me in a dialectical adventure, a dialogue, which my books only represent a beginning, not an end.</p>
