      <p><i>"The Golden Dialetik is the constant source of reality and science is the study of reality."  (The Golden Dialetik, 2016, p.37)</i></p>
      <p>The Scientific Method is a philosophical approach to reality, encapsulated in a set of techniques for investigating various types of phenomenon.  As Carl Jung once noted, the scientific method rotates around the concept of causality, and what an exploration of causality can provide. (I Ching, Forward by C. G. Jung, 1968, p. xxii )  He refers to causality as an axiom.  From the Oxford English dictionary, the definition of the scientific method is “a method or procedure that has characterized natural science since the 17th century, consisting in systematic observation, measurement and experiment, and the formulation, testing and modification of hypotheses” (“scientific method”, Oxford Dictionaries: British and World English, 2016, retrieved 13th June 2016). </p>
      <p>There are really two components to the Scientific Method:</p>
      <p></p>
      1)	The object in reality that the Scientific Method hopes to “observe,” and <br>
      2)	The procedures employed to perform the analysis via observation, hypothesis creation and testing.<br>
      <p></p>
      <p>The one basic maxim behind the Scientific Method is the belief that there is an order.  Even in today’s era of chaos theory, the expectation is that there is an order behind the chaos.  In this context, a truth is a discovered “order,” such as the three laws of motion were an order discovered by Isaac Newton.  Order does not imply an intelligence beyond the order.  From this perspective, to fully understand the Scientific Method, both reality and the procedures to “observe” reality need to be shown together.</p>
      <p>From the dictionary definition alone, the inherent question is what is being observed.  Jung suggested causality, but causality doesn’t provide the full picture.  Jung even provided acausality to a degree through his concept of Synchronicity, but like causality, although linked, these two concepts lose their dynamic nature.  Of course, Jung was focused on psychological applications, whereas the scientific method applies to all levels of scientific inquiry.</p>
      <p><i>"Science accepts that causality is central to reality, as the testability of cause and effect are central to the scientific method.  The Golden Dialetik builds upon this basic assumption, adding the complementary concept of acausality, which is comprised of causal elements, working in concert to produce a causal event."    (The Golden Dialetik, 2016, p.39)</i></p>
      <p>As the full description of the Golden Dialetik describes, causality is really part of a larger dialectical complex, whereby the causal path (cause (causal element) and effect (causal event or causal incident)) is integrated into the dialectical process.  (See the Golden Dialetik page on this site for a fuller description of the basic dialectical process.)</p>
      <p></p>

      <p></p>
      <p>This revision of the scientific method can perceive a cloud of acausal chains, which are in the relative vicinity of an observed causal path (highlighted in maroon).  The current scientific verbiage would describe these as variables, which would need to be reduced from the scientific exploration, but this description is hiding the fact that each variable has its own origin, its own causal path (cause and effect connection).</p>
      <p>Whatever the “reality” to be investigated, the causal path to be evaluated is the “object that the Scientific Method hopes to observe.”   The scientific method could be summarized that there is a phenomenon to be observed, as noted, from which a hypothesis is derived and that hypothesis in turn is tested; then the process repeats, which process could be described as follows:</p>
      <p></p>
      <center><img src="img/PNG Scientific Method.PNG" alt="Dialektical Scientific Method" class=""textWrap"></center>
      <p></p>
      <p>In this simplistic presentation of the scientific method, the “reality” of causality/acausality is always the observed phenomenon, whether this is a physical phenomenon, such as the combining of three atoms to form a molecule of water (H2O), or a psychological (soft science) analysis.  The range of the “causes” to be plugged into this model is unbounded.</p>
<p>So the scientific method is to observe a particular causal path with the understanding that this causal path stretches back indefinitely.  As part of the scientific inquiry, acausal elements need to be removed from the investigation.  This new vision of the scientific method reveals that a causal path is surrounded by a virtually unlimited cloud of acausal elements.  These variables need to be reduced right from the beginning by systematically removing these acausal variables from the observation, as the testing and observation refines the hypothesis.  This process continues until a constantly repeatable result allows the scientist to postulate the discovery of an “order,” a “truth,” relative to the limits of the technological limits of the era the scientist lives in.</p>
<p>Another common factor in the scientific method is to snip off the origins of the causal path of the reality being observed, bringing the observable timeframe from indefinite to a manageable timeframe.  An example would be observing a hydrogen atom.  Scientists need to be myopic, and ignore the cosmic genesis of a particular hydrogen atom to start an analysis at a convenient point in the causal chain to facilitate the observation.</p>
<p>From a practical perspective, this does not change people’s current use of the scientific method, but provides a more in-depth and consistent vision for it.  There is a next step to understanding the scientific method, but this will be described in the <a href="http:gdscientificmethodexpanded.html">Expanded Scientific Method</a> discussion.</p>
