      <p>Metaphysics is a sprawling concept, beginning with Aristotle, but overflowing the philosophical embankments and in some circles becoming another name for spiritualism.  Golden Metaphysics does not attempt to explain all of metaphysics, but the part of metaphysics that is closest to reality, causality.</p>
      
      <p><i>"The Golden Dialetik is a return to true metaphysics, a metaphysical concept that explains the physical world." (The Golden Dialetik, p.41)</i></p>
      <p></p>
      <center><img src="img/PNG gdoldcausal.PNG" alt="Current Causality" class=""textWrap"></center>
      <p></p>
      <p>There is an assumption in philosophy that causality is one, distinct thing, but identification of this one thing that is causality has been elusive; this issue could be construed to be the metaphysical blob that ate Western philosophy.   Western philosophy compensated by reverse engineering what this causal blob could be, sometimes with mirrors (seeing reverse images of the reverse engineering).  Examples of this could be (a) universals, (b) particulars, (c) properties, on to (d) atomism, or (e) monism, etc.  The range is staggering and all based on an <i>a priori</i> (assumed cause/effect) process.  Over the years, this assumption has proven to be cloudy at best (hence my poor representation of a cloud in the illustration above).   Philosophers have not necessarily been wrong, per se, but like the ancient story of blind men describing an elephant by feeling its parts, no philosopher has seen the whole elephant, or in this case the metaphysical blob of causality.</p>
      <p>If causality encapsulated in the concept of the Golden Dialetik is that "one thing," and the Golden Dialetik does lead us to a unified theory of causality, metaphysics and physics (natural science) will be recognized as seamlessly connected.  David Hume referred to causality as the "cement" of reality; so, when causality goes through a profound transformation, philosophy will have no choice but to follow.  (Please note that this is why it is highly recommended to read the webpages <a href="http:goldendialetik.html">The Golden Dialetik</a> and <a href="http:gdialetikexpanded.html">The Golden Dialetik:  An Advanced View.)</a>  </p>

      <p></p>
      <p>Looking at possibilities and potential, all of a sudden the picture of the philosophy of metaphysics could be turned upside down.  The tradition of "reverse engineering philosophy" is obsolete, which changes the angles of research from looking backward at a vague representation of causality to resynchronizing all previous philosophical research in this area with the new concept of causality (arrows pointing away from causality).  </p>
      <p>My book, <i>The Golden Sphere:  A Cosmology of the Dialectic</i> (1990), first outlines this dialectical theory.  The book, <i>The Golden Dialetik: The Unifying Theory of the Universe</i> (2014), devotes a chapter on this theory of causality, calling it Golden Dialetik, before moving into an expansive mythological/metaphysical discussion.  This webpage presents a rudimentary review of how the Golden Dialetik impacts metaphysics, but in my new book, <i>The Golden Metaphysics:  A Metaphysical Phantasy of a Unified Theory of Causality</i> (yes, by demand of friends and family, I have changed the proposed name of this book) is scheduled to be published in 2017, I will be performing a fuller exploration and explanation of philosophy's metaphysics.  The plan for this book is to demonstrate a more complete picture of the cosmology of the Dialetikal realm, but also explain how various current theories of causalism and/or reality can be perceived as integrated parts of the Golden Metaphysics.</p>
      <p>The purpose of this webpage is to simply demonstrate the relevance of the Golden Dialetik to metaphysics.  Traditional metaphysics is broken up between the Ancient and Medieval Eras.   As mentioned, the vast realm of metaphysics makes a starting point difficult to find, so I will be limiting my discussion to parts of the philosophy of metaphysics from the Ancient Era.  Arising with Aristotle, this era outlines the foundational aspects of metaphysics, while the Medieval Era extrapolated and expanded off this base.  The Golden Dialetik harkens back to this Ancient Era, and does not venture into the Medieval Era concepts directly, if at all, on this website.</p>
      <p>Although reportedly Aristotle did not really use the term, metaphysics (the term and the concept) arise from Aristotle’s works covering the following three basic subjects:<br>
    <br>
    •	First cause<br>
•	Unchanging Things<br>
    •	Beings as such (Non-Being)</p>
      <p>There is more to Aristotelian metaphysics (categories & substance) and the Medieval Era subjects of metaphysics, but for this quick online review, I am leaving them for another time.  Even beyond the boundaries of recognized philosophy, there is much more to metaphysics, but the Golden Dialetik does not pretend to answer all their conditions and the resulting questions.  The Golden Dialetik focuses solely on understanding these first three Aristotelian subjects.</p>
      <p>Once my foray into philosophy is attempted, I will move into an area more in tune with my book, The Golden Dialetik, where I envision the metaphysical realm, a cosmology, so to speak.  Due to this, I am providing a couple more subjects, which have naturally arisen from my perambulations.<br>
    <br>
    •	Where physics and metaphysics meet<br>
•	Vision of the cosmology of the metaphysical realm</p>
<p>Assuming that you understand the Golden Dialetik, this dialectical phenomenon is at the core of all metaphysics, and could represent a new foundation for metaphysical discussion, but it will also bring forth a vision of this metaphysical structure.</p>

<h3>Overview of the Golden Dialetik</h3>

<p>The Golden Dialetik is built around these two concepts.<br>
     <br>
    <i>"Causal - Causality is the principle that everything has a cause and effect, which could be likened to a string or thread of causal events.  <br>
        Acausal - An acausal event is the concurrence in relative spacetime of two or more unrelated causal threads." (The Golden Dialetik, p.8)</i></p>
<p>As detailed on the webpage, <a href="http:goldendialetik.html">The Golden Dialetik</a>  is comprised of an infinite number of dialectical processes.  The premise is that causality is an incomplete concept, but only exists in a dialectical setting where the thesis is causality and the antithesis is acausality.</p>
<p><i>"Reality consists of virtually an infinite number of elements moving in causal paths.  The Golden Dialetik puts forth the assertion that causality is part of a dialectical process, for most people the only observable part, which works in concert with acausality."  (The Book of the Joyful Way, p.15)</i></p>
<p>The interplay between the thesis and antithesis result in a synthesis, which in turn becomes the new thesis in a new dialectic.  The dialectical structure never varies, but content of the causal and the related acausal structures are infinite.</p>
<p>In essence, reality is comprised of two parts, the metaphysical and the physical, meeting within this cosmic dialectic, comprised of causality and acausality.  This is where the rubber (metaphysics) meets the road (physics/physical reality).</p>
<p>This cosmic dialectical process expands in scope and relates to the reality that we know in different ways, creating creating this reality dynamically, but the actual dialectical structure never changes.  When temporality is included in this cosmic dialectical model, I refer to this as a dialetik.  </p>
<h3>First Cause</h3>

<p>The Golden Dialetik approaches “first cause” semantically from a different direction.  Within the concept of the Golden Dialetik, first cause is subordinate to the dialectical process.  Causality exists only within the context of the thesis, antithesis, or synthesis structure of the dialectic. </p>
<p>The search for the first cause is supplanted by finding the first synthesis, or as I have described it, the primordial synthesis, which spins off dualities as dialectical by-products.  The first duality produced by the primordial synthesis contains the first cause.</p>
<p><i>"When a person experiences the Golden Dialetik through the lens of the past or future, one senses infinity to the limits of one’s capability...  These perspectives are infinite, but many times the perceiver finds a “beginning” or an “end.”  These perceived apices are not a true beginning or end, but represent the limit of the perceiver, yet at the perceiver’s limit, a brief view of infinity provides a glimpse at the Primordial Synthesis, the primal state before the first dialectic has occurred."  (The Golden Dialetik, p.25)</i></p>
<p>Causality is part of this duality structure, and cannot be separated from its corresponding object (acausality), whereas the primordial synthesis represents a wholeness or One-ness, prior to the existence of any duality.  In other words, there is only the wholeness or Oneness of the first synthesis, and the subsequent interplay of dualities afterwards.</p>  
<p>Dualities are dialectical by-products.

In other words, there is only the wholeness or Oneness of the first synthesis, and the subsequent interplay of dualities afterwards.</p>

<h3>Unchanging Things</h3>

<p><i>"One aspect of the Golden Dialetik that needs to be broached is the elegant realization that the Golden Dialetik never changes, but the results of all the cycles of the Golden Dialetik create an infinite reality.  The basic dialectical process is the same whether it is taken out of context or part of the creation of the universe; the dynamic is between a thesis, antithesis and synthesis.  Infinitely applied, the results of this cycle are infinitely variable.  This leads to three axioms that were detailed in <i>The Golden Dialetik</i>:<br>
    <br>
    •	The Golden Dialetik is perfect and is the one point of perfection in the universe<br>
    •	The Universe was made imperfect <br>
    •	Although the dialectical structure permeates the Dialetik and the Golden Dialetik at all levels, the basic structure is unchanging in form.  In essence, the Golden Dialetik never changes, but is the source of all change."  (The Golden Dialetik, p.28-29)</i></p>

<p>Reality is infinitely variable, but the dialectical structure, regardless of the level of perception being assumed, always remains unchanging and eternal, as per the 3rd axiom.  Western philosophy attempts to define unchanging aspects of physical reality, but this is not a productive approach, since in deference to the objects relative timeframes (milliseconds or billions of years) there is nothing in physical reality that is unchanging.  Every physical object and/or the attributes of those objects change. Only in the metaphysical realm can we find an eternally unchanging concept, the Golden Dialetik.</p>

<h3>Beings as such (Non-Being)</h3>

<p>Admittedly leaning towards an Eastern philosophical bias for this issue, <i>The Golden Dialetik</i> describes a version of Being and Non-Being in <i>The Book of the Joyful Way</i>:</p>
<p><i>"People view their lives as a ‘straight-line between birth and death.’  This straight-line could be construed as a progression of cause and effect experiences.  Each person is immersed in their lives from beginning to end, and from this perspective each person is the same person during this span of time with ephemeral aspects of their personality changing due to the challenges of life, but the same continuous persona exists.  This is Being, and the underlying connective tissue is the causalistic nature of this hypothetical person’s perspective, the belief in an unchanging persona."</i></p>
<p><i>"An extended view of this causalistic Being includes ‘things.’   As each of us walk through life, there is no escaping that ‘things’ will insert themselves into our path, becoming part of our perceived ‘straight-line’ experience.  These ‘things’ can range from objects, such as earth, grass, food, home, etc., to mother, father, wife and children.   A ‘straight-line’ without ‘things’ joining and leaving would be a very alienated, barren life.  The inclusion of ‘things’ in a person’s life then becomes a matter of awareness of how much one clings to these things, because as many have stated, all things must pass."</i></p>
<p><i>"From this extended causal view of a person’s life, Being crosses the threshold where the clarity of causalism erodes, and we are introduced to acausalism.  Each ‘thing,’ regardless of sentience or non-sentience, is engaged in its own causal path.  A pebble in a rock garden began its existence in the middle of a star, creating the molecules that would eventually form in a planet (the Earth), which then exuded a boulder onto the planet’s crust to cool and harden.  Over a millennia of millennium, this large rock was ground down by weathering forces to finally be picked up by a person as a pebble to be included in this rock garden.  After a lifetime, the owner of this rock garden will have passed off this Earth and maybe the rock garden is no longer a rock garden and the rock continues on its own causal path."</i></p>
<p><i>"For a short time the rock has become part of this person’s causal path, even if he or she never touches the pebble, even if the connection is only a visual.  One crisp cool morning with the sun shining and the sky a shiny blue, this hypothetical person, let’s say you, sees the pebble among a small pile of pebbles.  You are on your own causal path, but for this moment you spy something that you perceive is linked to you, but on its own causal path parallel to you.  Although you may see this as a causal perception, this is acausality.  All ‘things’ are on their own causal path, but this object’s causal path runs parallel to your causal path and during these times they are often perceived as being part of your Being."</i></p>
<p><i>"Non-being flips this perspective on its head, viewing everything acausally.  Acausality is comprised of the concurrence in relative spacetime of two or more unrelated causal threads, most commonly an infinite number, which Non-being attempts to embrace to achieve a very different vision of reality.  A human life is not perceived as a ‘straight-line,’ but as a set of unconnected moments where a sentience passes through time.  The person from moment to moment is not the same person, even though the memories may carry forward, due to the capacity of the human brain, but this is an illusion.  This perspective recognizes ‘things’ as objects on their own causal paths, which cannot be “owned” or bonded to an acausal path, since it is a non-existing causal path.   This is Non-being as opposed to not Being.  There is nothing to bond to.  Everything, even one’s own life, exists in relative human spacetime, but Non-being recognizes that every element of one’s perceived reality is separate, even one’s consciousness. You are not the same person that started reading this paragraph."   (The Book of the Joyful Way, p.20-21)</i></p>
<p>Although not tracking closely with Western philosophy, this discussion on Being and Non-Being fulfills the second Aristotelian subject, helping to classify the Golden Dialetik as a discourse on metaphysics.</p>

<h3>Metareality</h3>

    <p><i>"Scientists will initially see the “vision” as leading to religious views, but this is a unifying theory of the universe and is really a metaphysical discussion ...  This is a book about where metaphysics and physics coincide."  (The Golden Dialetik, p.XIV-XV)</i></p>
    <p>Both "physics" and "metaphysics" are semantic accidents.   Physics really should be translated as either "natural science" or "physical," and as everyone knows metaphysics, a term never used by Aristotle, are topics that come after the books on physics, but to his credit Aristotle was attempting to describe a concept he could not see, as opposed to the physical reality that he could see. </p>
    <p>The Golden Dialetik is a dialectical structure that is comprised of causality and acausality.  On the one side there is the reality of the dialectical structure, a metaphysical reality, and on the other side there is the physical reality, or reality with lower-case "r."  In the structure of the Golden Dialetik, these two separate realities synchronize to create Reality with an upper-case "R".</p>
      <p></p>
      <center><img src="img/PNG gdreality.PNG" alt="Current Causality" class=""textWrap"></center>
      <p></p>
      <p>Metareality is defined as the construct through which physical reality flows to create Reality.  Western philosophers would apply the terms <i>a posteriori</i> (reality) and <i>a priori</i> (metareality) to this division, but the Golden Dialetik is the first time a direct connection between metaphysical reality and natural reality has been demonstrated.</p>
    <p>Regardless of the semantic shenanigans, there was and is an underlying metaphysical reality, a metareality of dialectical activity, which Aristotle was trying to grapple with, but this metareality interfaces with the physical reality that you or I deal with every day. The metaphysical reality is not real, as we know of reality, but does exist with its own order, where the laws of physical reality do not apply, such as the laws of physics.</p>
    <p>From a human perspective metaphysics is not "real," until we understand that metaphysics and natural science, including physics, actually are interrelated. One cannot exist without the other.  The unified concept of causality in the Golden Dialetik accentuates this inter-reality capacity, where the dialectical structure meets causality/acausality to create Reality.  This is the Reality where reality (natural science/physics) and metaphysics interface.</p>  
    <p>Where can we see this?  The quick answer is everywhere and in everything you see, touch and taste.  Anything in the range of your senses, and of all the sense enhancing tools that humanity can come up with (microscopes, telescopes, etc.).  The dialectical continuum culminating in the Golden Dialetik creates the reality all about us, but is itself not part of that reality.</p>
    <p>In information technology, there is an analogy for metareality in regards to data and metadata.  Data is the reality, the real substance that computers push around from place to place and display.   Metadata is data about data.  This set of data mainly exists to help organize, package, and/or move data around, but is not the data being moved. Assuming one was a sentient bit of data on a computer, "data" does not even know metadata exists. The analogy is that data is the reality that we are familiar with, but loosely metadata corresponds to the Golden Dialetik, the data we don’t normally see. As data eventually has to interface with metadata to be functional, reality has to interrelate with metareality.  As all analogies have to end, the analogy ceases when one realizes that metadata does not create data, whereas metareality of the Golden Dialetik creates reality.</p>
    <p>In conclusion there is an interface where physical reality and a metaphysical reality interface in the Golden Dialetik, through the dialectical core modalities (thesis-causality as antithesis-acausality), which the Dialetik is comprised of.  As the elements of reality (anything within the concept of natural science) cycle through the Golden Dialetik; this is where physics and the reality of natural science interface with metaphysics.  </p>

<h3>Cosmology of the Metaphysical Realm</h3>

<p><i>"The simplicity of the dialectical form is deceiving, as the Vision is not the end of the vision, just the beginning."  (The Golden Dialetik, p.50)</i></p>
<p>In <i>The Golden Dialetik</i> there is a mysterious section called ‘The Vision.’  This vision stretches over several pages, so I will not be replicating it here, but the point of this vision is to begin “seeing” the dialetikal metaphysical structure.  My contention is that this abstract metareality is intellectually observable, and has been since the beginning of human sentience.  Some of the more renowned observations have been by the prophets of old, and recorded within the pages of holy books, but metareality creates reality, so everyone, every day, engages this metareality to a greater or lesser degree of awareness.  Interestingly, my observations within my book also describe a cosmology of this dialectical structure, as outlined in 'The Vision.'</p>
<p><i>"When the sphere synchronizes with the disk of the “present,” a different view of the sphere is exposed as the disk acts as a polarizing lens. I suddenly see a spiraling tunnel, projecting into an infinite future."  (The Golden Dialetik, p.2)</i></p>
<p>One of the conundrums of ancient literature is to dovetail the nature of the infinite with the finite.  These both exist in the human condition, and both have been observed in the metaphysical realm.  During my exploration of the Golden Dialetik, there are infinite and finite aspects to this phenomenon, and both present profound faces to the observer.  For example, Lao Tzu, the author of the <i>Tao Te Ching</i>, describes the infinite and finite together:</p>
    <i>"The Tao is emptiness and nothingness,<br>
    Emptiness is not nothingness,<br>
    As the bounded and the infinite exist<br>
    Within the confines of the One."<br>
    (The Book of the Joyful Way, p.42, inspired by Tao Te Ching, chapter 6)</i><br>
    <p></p>
<p>The “bounded” or finite and the infinite exist together to create the One or, as Lao Tzu would say, the Tao.  In high school I was enamored by geometry and to this subject I turned to understand this phenomenon.  With a perspective centered in the middle of an infinite cylinder, when you look at the ends of the cylinder, down a tunnel, so to speak, your perspective is attempting to perceive the infinite, but when you start looking perpendicularly away from this tunnel view, the finite walls of the cylinder emerge.  This vision of the infinite cylinder explains this supposed puzzle how the bounded and the unbounded can coexist.   With this clarification Lao Tzu's cryptic assertion is no longer a riddle.</p>
<p><i>"(In the book, The Golden Dialetik,) I discuss an infinite dialetik and then mention a beginning and an end, inferring a finite condition.  Initially, the suggestion of simultaneously infinite and finite states sounds contradictory, but the image of an “infinite cylinder” may help.  In geometry, an infinite cylinder may extend infinitely in opposite directions, but the cylinder wall is finite, hence it is infinite and finite at the same time."   (The Golden Dialetik, p.24)</i></p>
    <p>This conundrum can be explained, if one embraces this "infinite cylinder" perspective of metaphysics, but this also provides us a  peek at a metaphysical object in metareality, which opens the door for a proposed cosmology of metaphysical reality.</p>
    <h3>Note on Scientific Method</h3>
    <p></p>
    <p>One of the interesting outcomes of this unified theory of causality is how easily it fits into a model of the scientific method.  This was so intriguing that there are two pages on this website specifically to discuss this: <a href="http:gdscientificmethod.html">The Scientific Method per the Golden Dialetik</a> and <a href="http:gdscientificmethodexpanded.html">The Scientific Method per the Golden Dialetik:  Expanded View</a>.</p>  
        <p>In terms of metaphysics, this transparent extension into scientific methodology supports the contention that this unified theory of causality potentially has some merit. </p>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Summary</h3>
<p><i>"The Golden Dialetik is and has always been the engine behind reality.  Men of all ages have been attempting to capture its essence from glimpses of the Golden Dialetik in its various stages as described by the Vision.  The Dialetikal process is dynamic and active, and produces everyday life.   Understanding the Golden Dialetik will open people’s minds to a world of wonder, but first one has to understand the intricacies of the dialetikal process."</i></p>
<p><i>"Viewing the dialetik as a thread of dialectical events extending indeterminately into the past, the dialectic could be observed, simplistically, as causality.  Causality is just one characteristic of the dialectical structure, but the most visible feature.  Acausality, the occurrence of two or more unrelated causal events in relative spacetime, is the second facet of the dialectic.  Causality and acausality are at the core of every thesis and antithesis, and the resulting synthesis connects this past duality to the present duality."</i></p>
<p><i>"From our actual physical world, which we try to understand through “science,” to the metaphysical, including the nature of the human condition, causality and acausality permeate all levels of reality through the dialectical process.  Employing solely causality, one can imagine how every atom in the universe reaches back to the beginning of time, which could be construed as the current Big Bang theory of cosmology.   Now place causality, accompanied by acausality, into the dialectic and one can envision a dialetik, a dialectical thread for one atom that extends infinitely into the past to a theoretical Big Bang related to all Dialetiks.  Extending this perspective to all atoms in your perspective is the next level of awareness.  This is the everyday physical reality that everyone is familiar with."  (The Golden Dialetik, p.11-12)</i></p>
<p><b>What does this all mean?  Maybe nothing, maybe everything!  (Pretty typical metaphysical answer!)  Among the current crop of official metaphysical scholars, there is a significant discussion about the value of metaphysics with theories espoused supporting both ends of the spectrum, either useless or of great value.  If the Golden Dialetik is embraced as actually stating a new understanding of causality, a unified theory of causality, then metaphysics can assume a rightful place as one of the most important areas in humanity's search for knowledge, arguably the most important.  Of course, if this theory is declared untenable, then it will melt into the background of eternity and disappear as another weird theory by an odd eccentric. </b></p>
