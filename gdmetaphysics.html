      <p><i>The Golden Dialetik is a return to true metaphysics, a metaphysical concept that explains the physical world.  (The Golden Dialetik, p.41)</i></p>
<p>Traditional metaphysics is broken up between the Ancient and Medieval Eras.   The Ancient Era basically reviewed the foundational issues of metaphysics, while the Medieval Era extrapolated and expanded off this foundation, sometimes creating new foundations for their own theories.  The Golden Dialetik harkens back to the Ancient Era, and does not venture into the Medieval Era concepts directly, if at all.</p>
<p>The book, <i>The Golden Dialetik: The Unifying Theory of the Universe</i>, devotes a significant portion of its pages to a different perspective on metaphysics.  If the Ancient and Medieval Eras could be called the 1st and 2nd generation approaches to metaphysics, then this could be called the 3rd generation, assuming that people find this approach metaphysically feasible.  The purpose of this webpage is to simply demonstrate the relevance of the Golden Dialetik to metaphysics, or some would call dialectical metaphysics.</p>
<p>Although reportedly Aristotle didn’t really use the term, metaphysics (the term and the concept) arise from Aristotle’s works covering the following three basic subjects:<br>
    <br>
    •	First cause<br>
    •	Beings as such (Non-Being)<br>
•	Unchanging Things</p>
<p>There is more to Aristotelian metaphysics (categories & substance) and the 2nd generational subjects of metaphysics, but for this quick online review, I am leaving these for another time.  There is much more to metaphysics, but the Golden Dialetik doesn’t pretend to answer all these conditions and their resulting questions.</p>
<p>The Golden Dialetik focuses solely on understanding these first three Aristotelian subjects, but then goes further into envisioning the metaphysical realm.  Due to this, I am providing a couple more subjects, which have naturally arisen from my studies of the Golden Dialetik.<br>
    <br>
    •	Where physics and metaphysics meet<br>
•	Vision of the cosmology of the metaphysical realm</p>
<p>Assuming that you understand the Golden Dialetik, this dialectical phenomenon is at the core of all metaphysics, and could represent a new foundation for metaphysical discussion, but it will also bring forth a vision of this metaphysical structure.</p>

<h3>Overview of the Golden Dialetik</h3>

<p>The Golden Dialetik is built around these two concepts.<br>
     <br>
    <i>Causal - Causality is the principle that everything has a cause and effect, which could be likened to a string or thread of causal events.  <br>
        Acausal - An acausal event is the concurrence in relative spacetime of two or more unrelated causal threads.  (The Golden Dialetik, p.8)</i></p>
<p>The Golden Dialetik is comprised of an infinite number of dialectical processes.  The premise is that causality is an incomplete concept, but only exists in a dialectical setting where the thesis is causality and the antithesis is acausality.</p>
<p><i>Reality consists of virtually an infinite number of elements moving in causal paths.  The Golden Dialetik puts forth the assertion that causality is part of a dialectical process, for most people the only observable part, which works in concert with acausality.  (The Book of the Joyful Way, p.15)</i></p>
<p>The interplay between the thesis and antithesis result in a synthesis, which in turn becomes the new thesis in a new dialectic.  The dialectical structure never varies, but the causal content and content of the related acausal structures are infinite.</p>

<h3>First Cause</h3>

<p>The Golden Dialetik goes into elaborate steps to understand first causes in its own way.</p>
<p><i>When a person experiences the Golden Dialetik through the lens of the past or future, one senses infinity to the limits of one’s capability...  These perspectives are infinite, but many times the perceiver finds a “beginning” or an “end.”  These perceived apices are not a true beginning or end, but represent the limit of the perceiver, yet at the perceiver’s limit, a brief view of infinity provides a glimpse at the Primordial Synthesis, the primal state before the first dialectic has occurred.  (The Golden Dialetik, p.25)</i></p>
<p>First, within the concepts of the Golden Dialetik, there is no first cause.  Since causality is subordinate to the dialectical process as envisioned in the Golden Dialetik, causality exists only within the context of the thesis, antithesis, or synthesis structure of the dialectic.  The first cause is supplanted by the first synthesis, or as I have described it, the primordial synthesis.  
Dualities are dialectical by-products.  Causality is part of this duality structure, and cannot be separated from its corresponding duality, whereas the primordial synthesis represents a wholeness, a Oneness, prior to the existence of any duality.  In other words, there is only the wholeness or One-ness of the first synthsis, and the subsequent interplay of dualities afterwards.</p>
<p>The primordial synthesis will be further discussed in the “Unchanging” section of this webpage.</p>

<h3>Beings as such (Non-Being)</h3>

<p>Admittedly leaning towards an Eastern philosophical bias for this issue, The Golden Dialetik describes a version of Being and Non-Being in <i>The Book of the Joyful Way</i>:</p>
<p><i>People view their lives as a ‘straight-line between birth and death.’  This straight-line could be construed as a progression of cause and effect experiences.  Each person is immersed in their lives from beginning to end, and from this perspective each person is the same person during this span of time with ephemeral aspects of their personality changing due to the challenges of life, but the same continuous persona exists.  This is Being, and the underlying connective tissue is the causalistic nature of this hypothetical person’s perspective, the belief in an unchanging persona.</i></p>
<p><i>An extended view of this causalistic Being includes ‘things.’   As each of us walk through life, there is no escaping that ‘things’ will insert themselves into our path, becoming part of our perceived ‘straight-line’ experience.  These ‘things’ can range from objects, such as earth, grass, food, home, etc., to mother, father, wife and children.   A ‘straight-line’ without ‘things’ joining and leaving would be a very alienated, barren life.  The inclusion of ‘things’ in a person’s life then becomes a matter of awareness of how much one clings to these things, because as many have stated, all things must pass.</i></p>
<p><i>From this extended causal view of a person’s life, Being crosses the threshold where the clarity of causalism erodes, and we are introduced to acausalism.  Each ‘thing,’ regardless of sentience or non-sentience, is engaged in its own causal path.  A pebble in a rock garden began its existence in the middle of a star, creating the molecules that would eventually form in a planet (the Earth), which then exuded a boulder onto the planet’s crust to cool and harden.  Over a millennia of millennium, this large rock was ground down by weathering forces to finally be picked up by a person as a pebble to be included in this rock garden.  After a lifetime, the owner of this rock garden will have passed off this Earth and maybe the rock garden is no longer a rock garden and the rock continues on its own causal path.</i></p>
<p><i>For a short time the rock has become part of this person’s causal path, even if he or she never touches the pebble, even if the connection is only a visual.  One crisp cool morning with the sun shining and the sky a shiny blue, this hypothetical person, let’s say you, sees the pebble among a small pile of pebbles.  You are on your own causal path, but for this moment you spy something that you perceive is linked to you, but on its own causal path parallel to you.  Although you may see this as a causal perception, this is acausality.  All ‘things’ are on their own causal path, but this object’s causal path runs parallel to your causal path and during these times they are often perceived as being part of your Being.</i></p>
<p><i>Non-being flips this perspective on its head, viewing everything acausally.  Acausality is comprised of the concurrence in relative spacetime of two or more unrelated causal threads, most commonly an infinite number, which Non-being attempts to embrace to achieve a very different vision of reality.  A human life is not perceived as a ‘straight-line,’ but as a set of unconnected moments where a sentience passes through time.  The person from moment to moment is not the same person, even though the memories may carry forward, due to the capacity of the human brain, but this is an illusion.  This perspective recognizes ‘things’ as objects on their own causal paths, which cannot be “owned” or bonded to an acausal path, since it is a non-existing causal path.   This is Non-being as opposed to not Being.  There is nothing to bond to.  Everything, even one’s own life, exists in relative human spacetime, but Non-being recognizes that every element of one’s perceived reality is separate, even one’s consciousness. You are not the same person that started reading this paragraph.  (The Book of the Joyful Way, p.20-21)</i></p>
<p>Although not tracking closely with Western philosophy, this discussion on Being and Non-Being fulfills the second Aristotelian subject, helping to classify the Golden Dialetik as a discourse on metaphysics.</p>
<h3>Unchanging Things</h3>
<p><i>One aspect of the Golden Dialetik that needs to be broached is the elegant realization that the Golden Dialetik never changes, but the results of all the cycles of the Golden Dialetik create an infinite reality.  The basic dialectical process is the same whether it is taken out of context or part of the creation of the universe; the dynamic is between a thesis, antithesis and synthesis.  Infinitely applied, the results of this cycle are infinitely variable.  This leads to three axioms that can be derived from the observations so far:<br>
    <br>
    •	The Golden Dialetik is perfect and is the one point of perfection in the universe<br>
    •	The universe was made imperfect <br>
    •	Although the dialectical structure permeates the Dialetik and the Golden Dialetik at all levels, the basic structure is unchanging in form.  In essence, the Golden Dialetik never changes, but is the source of all change.  (The Golden Dialetik, p.28-29)</i></p>

<p>Reality is infinitely variable, but the dialectical structure, regardless of the level of perception being assumed, always remains unchanging and eternal, as per the 3rd axiom.  Western philosophy attempts to define unchanging aspects of physical reality, but this is not a productive approach, since in theory over astronomical timeframes there is nothing in physical reality that we know which is unchanging.  Only in the metaphysical realm can we find an eternally unchanging concept, the Golden Dialetik.</p>

<h3>Where Physics and Metaphysics Meet</h3>
<p><i>Scientists will initially see the “vision” as leading to religious views, but this is a unifying theory of the universe and is really a metaphysical discussion ...  This is a book about where metaphysics and physics coincide.   (The Golden Dialetik, p.XIV-XV)</i></p>
<p>Maybe the concept of metaphysics is a semantic accident, but in a sense this concept was needed.  There is an underlying reality, a metareality, which this concept was trying to grapple with, but this metareality is not part of the reality that you or I deal with every day.  Reality in this sense is defined as the physical world about us, which is ruled by many laws of physical reality, such as the general laws of physics.  Metaphysics is a metareality that is not real, as we know it, but does exist with its own metaphysical order, where the physical laws of reality do not necessarily apply.</p>
<p>Metaphysics is not "real," until we understand that metaphysics and physics actually coincide.   The Golden Dialetik demonstrates this capacity; where the question then arises:  Where does reality (physics) and metaphysics interface?  The quick answer is everywhere and in everything you see, touch and taste.  Anything in the range of your senses, and of all the sense enhancing tools that humanity can come up with (microscopes, telescopes, etc.).  The dialectical continuum culminating in the Golden Dialetik creates the reality all about us, but is itself not part of that reality.</p>
<p>In information technology, there is an analogy for reality/metareality in regards to data and metadata.  Data is the reality, the real substance that computers push around from place to place and display.   Metadata is data about data.  This set of data mainly exists to help organize, package, and/or move data around, but is not the data being moved.  The analogy is that data is reality, but loosely metadata corresponds to metareality.  As data eventually has to interface with metadata to be functional, reality has to interrelate to metareality.  As all analogies have to end, the analogy ceases when one realizes that metadata does not create data, whereas metareality does create reality.</p>
<p>The key to the Golden Dialetik is that its core modalities (thesis-causality and antithesis-acausality) generates reality; this is where physics and reality in general interface with metaphysics.  In conclusion there is a metaphysical basis for reality, which has up to now not been adequately explored.</p>

<h3>Cosmology of the Metaphysical Realm</h3>

<p><i>The simplicity of the dialectical form is deceiving, as the Vision is not the end of the vision, just the beginning.  (The Golden Dialetik, p.50)</i></p>
<p>In The Golden Dialetik there is a mysterious section called ‘The Vision.’  This vision stretches over several pages, so I will not be replicating it here, but the point of this vision is to begin “seeing” the dialetikal metaphysical structure.  My contention is that this metareality is observable, and has been since the beginning of human sentience.</p>
<p>Some of the more renowned observations have been by the prophets of old, and recorded within the pages of holy books, but metareality creates reality, so everyone, every day, engages this metareality to a greater or lesser degree.  Interestingly, my observations within my book also describe a cosmology of the dialectical structure.</p>
<p><i>When the sphere synchronizes with the disk of the “present,” a different view of the sphere is exposed as the disk acts as a polarizing lens. I suddenly see a spiraling tunnel, projecting into an infinite future.  (The Golden Dialetik, p.2)</i></p>
<p>One of the conundrums of ancient literature is to dovetail the nature of the infinite with the finite.  These both exist in the human condition, and both have been observed in the metaphysical realm.</p>
<p><i>(In the book, The Golden Dialetik,) I discuss an infinite dialetik and then mention a beginning and an end, inferring a finite condition.  Initially, the suggestion of simultaneously infinite and finite states sounds contradictory, but the image of an “infinite cylinder” may help.  In geometry, an infinite cylinder may extend infinitely in opposite directions, but the cylinder wall is finite, hence it is infinite and finite at the same time.   (The Golden Dialetik, p.24)</i></p>
<p>During exploration of the Golden Dialetik, there are infinite and finite aspects to this phenomenon, and both present profound faces to the observer.  Using Lao Tzu of Taoism fame observes the Tao as both infinite and finite, but this conundrum can be explained, if one embraces this "infinite cylinder" cosmology of metaphysics.<br>
    <br>
    <i>The Tao is emptiness and nothingness,<br>
    Emptiness is not nothingness,<br>
    As the bounded and the infinite exist<br>
    Within the confines of the One.<br>
    (The Book of the Joyful Way, p.42, inspired by Tao Te Ching, chapter 6)</i></p>

<p>The “bounded” or finite and the infinite exist together to create the One or, as Lao Tzu would say, the Tao.  With a perspective centered in the middle of an infinite cylinder, when you look at the ends of the cycle, your perspective is attempting to perceive the infinite, but when you start looking perpendicularly, the finite walls of the cylinder emerge.  This vision of the infinite cylinder explains this supposed puzzle how the bounded and the unbounded can coexist.   With this clarification Lao Tzu's cryptic assertion is no longer a riddle.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<i><p>The Golden Dialetik is and has always been the engine behind reality.  Men of all ages have been attempting to capture its essence from glimpses of the Golden Dialetik in its various stages as described by the Vision.  The Dialetikal process is dynamic and active, and produces everyday life.   Understanding the Golden Dialetik will open people’s minds to a world of wonder, but first one has to understand the intricacies of the dialetikal process.</p>
<p>Viewing the dialetik as a thread of dialectical events extending indeterminately into the past, the dialectic could be observed, simplistically, as causality.  Causality is just one characteristic of the dialectical structure, but the most visible feature.  Acausality, the occurrence of two or more unrelated causal events in relative spacetime, is the second facet of the dialectic.  Causality and acausality are at the core of every thesis and antithesis, and the resulting synthesis connects this past duality to the present duality.</p>
<p>From our actual physical world, which we try to understand through “science,” to the metaphysical, including the nature of the human condition, causality and acausality permeate all levels of reality through the dialectical process.  Employing solely causality, one can imagine how every atom in the universe reaches back to the beginning of time, which could be construed as the current Big Bang theory of cosmology.   Now place causality, accompanied by acausality, into the dialectic and one can envision a dialetik, a dialectical thread for one atom that extends infinitely into the past to a theoretical Big Bang related to all Dialetiks.  Extending this perspective to all atoms in your perspective is the next level of awareness.  This is the everyday physical reality that everyone is familiar with.  (The Golden Dialetik, p.11-12)</i></p>
