      <p><i>"The Golden Dialetik can now assure people that God exists, as long as they accept the existence of the Golden Dialetik.  If someone is an atheist, he can now know that Nothingness exists within the same context as God.  This is knowledge, not belief.  These are the first steps toward the One, the Tao, God and Nothingness.  This contradictory realization is the great irony, and also the great unity, behind humankind’s visions."  (The Book of the Joyful Way, 2016, p.27)</i></p>
      <p>The key to understanding the existence of God, is to understand the Golden Dialetik.  The Dialetik is the waterfall of reality which swirls around each and every one of us.  This is the same reality that science pokes and prods with humanity’s scientific method.  The Golden Dialetik is grounded in reality, so if you accept that reality exists, the Golden Dialetik exists.</p>
      <p>The true cynic would say, “first, what proof is there that this parallel dialetikal metaphysical reality exists, and secondly, what evidence that people have and can engage this different reality?”   At the core of the scientific method is the repeated act of observing a physical phenomenon.  In this case, the phenomenon being observed is metaphysical.  Historically, my “observers” among others start with all the prophets.   I do not view the prophets as crackpots, but highly intelligent men, the greatest scientists of their day, who have actually observed something as substantial as the sun.  In my book The Golden Dialetik, I provided four examples, but there are many more.</p>
      <p>Moses saw a burning bush and heard a voice.  Hesiod described the primal duality of Mother Earth and Father Sky.  The Rig-Veda, through the god Agni, envisions the One and the Many Gods.  Lao Tzu stands out because he reports two distinct engagements with the Golden Dialetik, Tao and God.</p>
      <p></p>
      <h4>Formless and Perfect</h4>
      <p></p>
      <p><i>"There is something existent, formless and perfect<br>
Born before the universe was born. <br>
Before heaven and Earth existed.<br>
It is silent, serene, ethereal, empty,<br>
Independent and constant but the source of all change<br>
Infinitely circulating and ceaseless, but eternally unchanging.<br>
Nameless, I can know not its Name, but I call it the Tao." <br>
(The Book of the Joyful Way, 2016, p.66 (Lao Tzu, Tao Te Ching, Chapter 25))<br></i></p>
      <p></p>
      <p><i>“Tao is older than the Lord (God).” <br>(The Golden Dialetik, 2016, p.143 (Lao Tzu, Tao Te Ching, Chapter 4))</i></p>
      <p>Like the Rosetta stone crossing boundaries, Lao Tzu engaged the Golden Dialetik and came away with two different experiences.  The first he called the Tao, and the second he described as the Lord or God.  Not knowing these were two experiences of the same phenomenon, he rationalized going with his Tao preference, as his Crystal Choice due to the chronological order of the experiences.</p>
<p>When I went to college, the original title for my degree was Mythopoeic Thought, and I learned from that experience that every myth contained some truth and also contained an explanation of that truth from the perspective of the society’s social and technical capabilities at the time.  These people, the prophets of old, did observe something.   If a scientist was reviewing results from multiple experiments, and found that from 50 observations, although different, there was an underlying phenomenon observed, would it not be safe to conclude that this phenomenon exists?  From these Prophet’s observations across the millennia, I have cobbled together the theory of the Golden Dialetik.  As part of this analysis, I have also been able to revise our understanding of the scientific method.</p>
<p>Are there any other experiences which could be used to support the contention of the existence of the Golden Dialetik?  From out of the World War II concentration camps, Victor Frankl emerged with a psychological theory centered on people finding “meaning,” but where do you find meaning?  Our curiosity requires that we pass our hand through this Dialetikal waterfall again and again in our lifetimes.  When one does, this is when you see a greater whole, a broader context in which your life fits.  The greater the vision of the infinite, the closer to seeing God one gets, but these lesser experiences are not inconsequential, but provide meaningfulness, as one returns to everyday life with a changed perspective.</p>
<p>Archimedes lever is a theory by Archimedes stating ‘given a large enough lever and a place to stand, you could move the Earth.’   A mathematician, Archimedes proposition has great validity, although a practical application would be humanly impossible.  From a psychological point of view, being very simplistic, let us say each of us are Archimedes’ person, and we each have a place to stand and a lever with which we keep our personal universe in place.  An example of experiencing the Dialetik, if you are not finding satisfaction with your current status, you commune and revisit the Golden Dialetik, but upon your return you would find that the place you previously stood at had changed a miniscule fraction of an inch.  This millionth of an inch would completely change the universe you are familiar with, opening a variety of new directions.  This analogy is at the heart of finding “meaning.”</p>
<p>Whether looking for God or just finding meaning, requires the courage to look beyond one’s finite reality to take in as much of the infinite that you possibly can.   The phenomenon underlying all these engagements is the Golden Dialetik, and in theory, the “scientific evidence” does exist to support not only that the Golden Dialetik exists, but subsequently that this reality can be engaged.  So, does God exist?  If this is your Crystal Choice, and you accept the concept of the Golden Dialetik completely, then yes, God undoubtedly exists.</p>
