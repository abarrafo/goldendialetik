      <p><i>Where people through the ages have found Lao Tzu talking in riddles, I find that he talks plainly.  He is not an enigma.  Through his words, through the translations of his words, through the miasma of thoughts standing as a cloud between him and me, I have found his contemplations contain a clarity that has at times startled me.  (The Golden Dialetik, p.127)</i></p>
      <p>Although there are many later texts and authors (Chuang Tzu, Lieh Tzu, etc.), Lao Tzu’s short book, the <i>Tao Te Ching</i>, remains the classic on the Tao.  In my book, <i>The Book of the Joyful Way</i>, I explored Lao Tzu’s chapters in light of my concepts from the Golden Dialetik.  I found his philosophy paralleled my own in many ways, but in some ways we are profoundly different.  There are three elements in Lao Tzu’s description about the Tao, which I would like to review here:  (1) Lao Tzu’s perception of the Tao, (2) Dualities, Being and Non-Being, and (3) The Middle Way and the Way.</p>
      <p>Please note that I am not describing Taoism, but the concepts of the Golden Dialetik, and how I see them in Lao Tzu's literature.</p>
<h3>The Tao</h3>
<p><h4>Formless, Perfect</h4>
<p><i>There is something existent, formless and perfect<br>
Born before the universe was born. <br>
Before heaven and Earth existed.<br>
It is silent, serene, ethereal, empty,<br>
Independent and constant but the source of all change<br>
Infinitely circulating and ceaseless, but eternally unchanging.<br>
Nameless, I can know not its Name, but I call it the Tao.<br>
(The Golden Dialetik, p. 87, inspired by the Tao Te Ching, chapter 25)</i></p>

<p>This primordial reality, which was “born” before dualities (“before heaven and earth”), is not inert in the present, but circulating ceaselessly.  The Tao is “formless and perfect.”  Once the first duality appears, the Tao is “silent, serene, ethereal and empty, but “circulating” the components of reality, ceaselessly, constantly creating reality.  The Tao is an eternal component, eternally unchanging, but changing everything:</p>
<p><i>Lao Tzu recognized how the Golden Dialetik changes all, but in the end remains unchanged.  This supposed riddle is not a riddle at all, nor does a contradiction exist.  The Golden Dialetik, thesis/antithesis/synthesis, past, future and now (present), structurally never changes, but the cycles of the Dialetik are never-ending, and the results of these Dialetikal circulations are the source of all change, supporting the third axiom of the Golden Dialetik.  (The Golden Dialetik, p. 89-90)</i></p>
<p>This description of the Tao has many counterparts in various cultures, called by many names, but Lao Tzu’s has a distinct clarity in his vision of the beginning and the Golden Dialetik. 
Lao Tzu was perceiving the Tao within an infinite cylinder, sometimes perceiving the infinite wall, and sometimes perceiving as far into the depths of infinity (down the tunnel of the infinite cylinder) as he could (see <a href="http:gdmetaphysics.html">Metaphysics</a>).  From my perspective, he was aware enough to be able to perceive in different ways the Golden Dialetik, which Lao Tzu would name as the nameless Tao.</p>
<p><i>Approach and the beginning cannot be seen<br>
Follow and the end cannot be found<br>
Unfathomable, it exists in the present<br>
But in the “now” you can experience the Tao,<br>
If you follow it and aspire <br>
To reach the ancient beginning.<br>
Wisdom is the effort and the effect<br>
Of unwinding of the Tao.  <br>
(The Golden Dialetik, p. 130, inspired by the Tao Te Ching, chapter 14)</i></p>

<p><i>Paraphrasing Lao Tzu, the Tao has no beginning and no end, but it does have a beginning (“source”).  This enigma is understandable, if you accept the premise that like a child turning an object around, Lao Tzu is viewing the same phenomenon from different angles. (The Golden Dialetik, p. 130-131)</i></p>
<p>The seeming paradox no longer is a conundrum.  If nothing else, I hope my explorations bring out the amazing clarity of Lao Tzu’s vision, which people have been misinterpreting for millennium. </p>
<h3>Dualities, Being and Non-Being</h3>
<p><i>The search for the beginning of this magnificent dialectical stream has been contemplated for years.  I liken this search to the image of a person looking at a mirror and on the wall behind her is a mirror.  In the mirror before her is a reflection of the mirror behind him and vice versa.  In both mirrors the image gets smaller and smaller.  If your eyes are really good, you may see maybe ten reflections deep, but you know in your mind in theory those reflections could go on forever; dualities upon dualities.  Let us say that you are that person.   You let your mind follow those reflections, and it becomes a dizzying path, but to where.  There is an end to this path, where the dualities stop, and this end is the final duality, the archetypal duality; this ultimate duality brings us to the doorstep of a Oneness where there are no dualities.  (The Book of the Joyful Way, p. 16)</i></p>
<p>Dualities are the tips of the iceberg, the visible part of the dialectical process.  If one progresses back to “the doorstep of a Oneness,” there is an archetypal duality before all dualities.  Each culture defines its own archetypal duality, and Lao Tzu’s was his concept of Being and Non-Being.</p>
<p></p>
<p><i>Balance the male hardness with the female softness.<br>
As all rivers flow together, so shalt you attract all things<br>
And as you experience the Tao, you will see the world<br>
Through the eyes of a child: eternal, simple, almost perfect.</i></p>

<p><i>Balance the white with the black, the light with the shadow<br>
And hold the pattern eternal in constant strength<br>
As you accept the Tao, the Tao will surge within you,<br>
But it will be best preserved by returning to the golden state</i></p>

<p><i>Balance the personal and the impersonal against your tribulations<br>
As the world offers fame and infamy in equal measure;<br>
If you accept the world as the world accepts you, within you<br>
The Tao will be luminous and thy glory shining will glow unseen. <br>
(The Golden Dialetik, p. 88-89, inspired by Tao Te Ching, chapter 28)</i></p>

<p>Dualities are central to Lao Tzu’s Taoism, but like boiling a stew down to its basic components, Lao Tzu found his basic duality in Being and Non-Being.  Where Lao Tzu found Being and Non-Being, I have found causality and acausality.  Being is continually associated with the material world.  The material world is another way of causally associating objects with oneself.  Non-being has a different connection.  Yes, everything is composed of parallel causal threads, but the relationship does not connect those objects causally, including one’s own perspective of self, but all objects have acausal connections.  It may help to think of causality as linear and acausality as a matrix.  From this starting point, Being and Non-Being (causality and acausality) opens the door to all dualities.
    <h4>Exploring Dualism</h4>
    <p><i>Dualities exist in abundance, with primordial dualities opposing each other forever;<br>
Light and dark, male and female, heaven and earth, these archetypal dualities stand out<br>
Like lighthouses at the end of a promontory overlooking a broad swath of murky waters.<br>
Yet the swirling waters are made up of lesser dualities, where light is various shades of blue<br>
And the male/female dichotomy of husband and wife revolves around a relationship <br>
Where control and submission, body and soul, are blurred constantly to attain wholeness. </i></p>

<p><i>Whether in stasis and appearing clearly, or twirling, creating kaleidoscopic spirals,<br>
Each duality exists as a process to restore balance through seeking a middle way.<br>
The bartering between opposite modalities is never-ending and replicated over and over.<br>
This dialectical interchange, often observed as a dialogue, is a process ad infinitum,<br>
Crisscrossing in a matrix of infinites ad infinita, amalgamating in the here and now,<br>
Coalescing in you as you read these words and contemplate the complexity of dualities.</i></p>

<p><i>Archetypal dualities represent elemental extremes, but dualities permeate existence;<br>
These observed dual states represent the tops of mountains or the sparkling tips of waves,<br>
The context is lost in the observing, when all you see is the duality and not the unity,<br>
Binding all together beneath the wave, reaching beyond limits, beyond boundaries.<br>
A unity bids that the One, the Tao, God, Allah and Nothingness are seen as One, and<br>
That ignorance, the ignoring of truth, will not sway people from searching for this unity. <br>
(The Book of the Joyful Way, p.51)</i></p>

<p>As one looks into the endless mirror at some point, there is a unity achieved, just beyond one’s ability to perceive it.  Lao Tzu perceived this unity, which he called the Tao.</p>
<h3>The Middle Way and the Way</h3>

<p><i>The Great Way is open to follow, smooth and plain,<br>
        Yet people take bypaths blindly away from the Way.<br>
        Where there is no balance, when excess holds sway<br>
        One and all have strayed from the Great Way<br>
(The Golden Dialetik, p. 133, inspired by Tao Te Ching, chapter 53)</i></p>
<p>The great way is like the grand avenues in Paris at the middle of which are the tracks for ancient wagons to trod, now paved over with roadways.    There is a wide thoroughfare, the grand middle way, and within this marvelous boulevard resides the Way, the roadway.</p>
<p>Obviously, finding and keeping to this thread within the middle way is not as easy as it sounds.  Only the adherence to truth and the effort to reduce the distraction of things (causality), can the Way be discovered.   Staying on the Way also requires great attention, because the distractions of causality are never-ending.</p>
<h4>Distractions</h4>

<p><i>The palette of colors that can be perceived is infinite.<br>
The range of sounds that can be heard is infinite.<br>
The array of flavors that the palate can taste is infinite.<br>
The touches of pleasure that can be felt are infinite.<br>
The desire for objects that can be encountered is infinite.<br>
These uncontrolled distractions can derange the mind,<br>
As ‘galloping thoughts’ and ‘hunts for indulgences.<br></i></p>

<p><i>The Master<br>
Works to understand that these senses are windows<br>
Into the house of his mind, but these openings<br>
Can be overwhelmed by impressions, distractions.<br>
Seeing through the eyes does not see all.<br>
Hearing and smelling do not provide all.<br>
Pleasure and indulgences do not satisfy all.<br>
Distinguishing from the froth of distractions<br>
The clear reality of one’s life is the objective.<br>
Only then can one discard the former for the latter.<br>
(The Book of the Joyful Way, inspired by the Tao Te Ching, chapter 12)</i></p>

<p>Causal distractions are a central problem for staying on the Way or even within the middle way.  In other cultures, major life-changing distractions could be called “sins,” but distraction can be big or small, and even the subtlest distraction can keep you from the Golden Dialetik.</p>
<p><i>When engaging the Golden Dialetik, a fusion of mind and Dialetikal Reality occurs, from which a glimmering light arises to touch one’s senses, without warmth or cold.  Sometimes this experience transforms into an anthropomorphic representation and sometimes not.  Looking for a criterion, such as an anthropomorphic vision, to appear to achieve communion with God is another distraction that has to be unlearned.  Moses did not see an anthropomorphic God.  Others have, but the expectation that you have to see an anthropomorphic God is a major hindrance.   (The Golden Dialetik, p. 185-186)</i></p>

<p>This refers not to the Crystal Choice you may have chosen, but to the distraction of the <b>expectation</b> that the Golden Dialetik will reveal itself to you in a particular way, such as a fatherly figure, or angels.  As mentioned in other webpages, sometimes you need to leave the Tao behind to find the Tao.  The Way is the Tao, and the advantage of the Way us that there are no expectations.   Whatever the Way reveals, whether a rock, a cloud, a God, or a stick, the pilgrim on his Way will accept it for what it is, not what he expects it to be.</p>
Finding the Way can be a lifelong effort, but staying on the real Way is a lifelong effort as well.  Great wise men and wise women have found the Golden Dialetik, the Way, and due to their pride have lost it within the moment of their finding.</p>
<h3>Final Thoughts</h3></p>
    <p><i>Although this book was inspired by the Tao Te Ching, this is NOT the Tao Te Ching.  As Taoism is driven by the concepts of Being and Non-being, this book is driven by the concept of the Golden Dialetik.  (The Book of the Joyful Way, p.8)</i></p>
    <p>Lao Tzu’s Taoism is not what I am presenting here or in the pages of my books.  Although at times my book, <i>The Book of the Joyful Way</i>, is being inaccurately classified under Taoism, the Golden Dialetik has a unique metaphysical foundation.</p>
