      <p>The Golden Dialetik is an alternative view of reality, and Crystal Choices are snapshots of the Golden Dialetik.  Some call these visions, these snapshots, the Tao, God, Allah, the One, Everythingness and Nothingness, plus an endless list of other names from other cultures, and finally the nameless.  In this screen, you will notice that I use these terms for the crystal choice, interchangeably, since they are all crystal choices.</p>
      <p><i>"Whenever a 'holy' person, a prophet, communed with God or Allah or the Tao or the One, they communed with Nothingness and Everythingness, calling it by whatever name they called their One, describing the Oneness within the context of their social and intellectual capacities."</i><br>
      <i>"Their faithful epiphanies were and are valued visions of the Golden Dialetik, but they were also static revelations of a dynamically changing reality, mingling their perceptions of the changeless with the changing."  (The Book of the Joyful Way, 2016, p.26</i></p>
      <p>There is an ancient story about a group of blind holy men.  They are each feeling a different part of an elephant.  Although many versions exist from India, China, Jainism, Sufism, etc., in this analogy, the elephant is the One (India).  Each is describing faithfully what they feel: a foot, a trunk, a leg, a tail, a head, etc.  This is the essence of what a crystal choice is; the elephant is the Golden Dialetik and the crystal choice is a snapshot vision of the Golden Dialetik.</p>
      <p>Every type of rational Crystal Choice has equal value in the realm of the Golden Dialetik, whether it is God(s) or atheism.  Both individuals and cultures are looking at the same reality, the Golden Dialetik, and seeing it in different ways.  Even the differences in names for this phenomenon (God, Allah, Jehovah, Nihilism, Nothingness, the One, etc.) are equal in the context of the Golden Dialetik.</p>
      <p>Many of these cultural versions of the Crystal Choice have existed for millennia and contain much more than an expression of the cultural perception of the Golden Dialetik.  Some have evolved into unifying theories of the universe, such as the Bible, accumulating historical context, but the bare bones reality is that the Golden Dialetik is with everyone every second of the day, whether you are a card carrying deist or an atheist.  Every person engages the Golden Dialetik, because this is reality behind the reality, in which you and I are directly involved with.</p>
      <p><i>"A person can accept the Dialetik of the culture or seek beyond to achieve a more direct perspective on the Golden Dialetik, but in either case this “choice” hardens that person’s vision into a set picture of the Golden Dialetik…  (For a society) the culture selects a crystalline shard and molds it into a consistent perspective for all in the culture."  (The Golden Dialetik, 2014, p.29)</i></p>
      <p>When a person chooses a Crystal Choice, a level of equanimity can be achieved.  For some, this is enough for a lifetime, but for others they need to see beyond this static veil.  In everyday life, this is requiring to seek truth, albeit a relative truth, in every aspect of one’s life.  As a wise man told me in his youth, “don’t promote ignorance,” because in this arena, ignorance is the greatest sin.</p>
The next realization is that the elephant is dynamically changing like a vast waterfall flowing through the holy man’s hands.  </p>
      <h4>Snapshot of a Waterfall</h4>

      <i><p>"Attempting to envision the One requires first attempting to envision a moment,<br>
      Seeing a snapshot of the whole is like envisioning the water in Niagara Falls.<br>
      Each molecule of water flowing over the falls has a causal path back to creation,<br>
      But each molecule is separate, but flowing in proximity together with others;<br>
      One molecule to countless molecules, a vast volume of water into a vast chasm.<br>
      When you look at a majestic waterfall, you glimpse the awesome immensity,<br>
      Stretching from the miniscule to the enormous, acausality links by not linking.<br>
      This crystallized vision gleams in the sunlight as a person chooses to remember,<br>
      Creating a crystal choice of light and liquid, and water thundering over the brink.<br>
      Then in a millisecond the snapshot shatters as the molecule of water is replaced<br>
      By another molecule of water and the accompanying acausal molecules swapped<br>
      For a new set of water molecules flowing together over the edge into the abyss.</br>
      Then millisecond after millisecond after millisecond thy crystal vision lapses<br>
      Into a remembrance that no longer accurately reflects the exact waterfall,<br>
      But provides just an approximation of the amazing vastness behind the Dialetik.<br>
      To see this waterfall again, one must see beyond this approximation once more,<br>
      To experience the Tao one must abandon the crystal choice once chosen <br>
      To choose once again, and again, and again, and again, and again, ad infinitum."<br>
      (The Book of the Joyful Way, 2016, p.110)</p></i>

      <p>If these wise men duplicated their experiences with this higher level of awareness, this waterfall, although they may still feel a foot in exactly the same way, the foot has profoundly changed from instant to instant, even though it appears to have remained the same.</p>
      <p><i>"The real Golden Dialetik is fluid and constantly moving, but when the “choice” is made, people have taken a snapshot which no longer changes.  Even a culture’s view of the Golden Dialetik is an unchanging snapshot.  The fluidity of the Golden Dialetik never stops, but that person’s (or culture’s) perception of the active Golden Dialetik ceases with the Crystal Choice."  (The Golden Dialetik, 2014, p.30-31)</i></p>
      <p>As described (see The Golden Dialetik:  Advanced), catching a glimpse of the Golden Dialetik is truly awesome.  I put forth this chapter on the Waterfall, again, which I also posted in The Golden Dialetik: Advanced View web page.</p>
      <p>The beauty of the waterfall analogy of touching the Golden Dialetik is that when every holy man touches this waterfall they come away with impressions of wetness, and yet they are all seeing different things, but this experience is not limited to the few.  In fact, everyone experiences the Golden Dialetik at one time and comes away confused and looking for explanations of what they just experienced, which drives people to choose a Crystal Choice.</p>
      <p><i>"This “choice” determines how a person or culture perceives the Golden Dialetik, taking a perfect whole and, like a gem cutter tapping a diamond, the Golden Dialetik is split into an infinite set of crystal fragments, each a Dialetik in their own right..."  (The Golden Dialetik, 2014, p.29)</i></p>
      <p>Upon selecting a Crystal Choice, personally a level of calmness is achieved, but this equable state of mind is dependent upon the vicissitudes of life.  Sometimes life does not cooperate in maintaining this composure and, to combat these fluctuations of fortune in one’s life, techniques have been developed, such as prayer, meditation, yoga, and other forms of stress reduction, but these will not always work.  For this and other reasons, the Crystal Choice will come into question and the person who has chosen their Crystal Choice may seek to find another, or desperately cling to their crumbling one at hand.</p>
      <p>One of the tenets of my theory is that anyone at any time can engage the Golden Dialetik.  You do not have to be a holy person (I am a prime example).  Using whatever technique you find the most effective for you, work to remove your distractions, but this means removing ALL distractions, including the ultimate distraction, your previous Crystal Choice.</p>
      <p><i>"If you believe in God, all these conditions, the One, God, Tao, intelligent and mechanical design, even atheism (Nothingness), are snapped images of a single source, or as I call these snapshots, Crystal Choices, and to see the whole picture, we have to embrace all these visions."</i><br>
      <i>"All are true visions; the problem is that humanity’s ability to accept this larger reality is very limited.  This concept ties back to transcending one’s own Crystal Choice.  Ironically, to commune with God, you have to give up God; to understand the Tao, you must let the Tao go."  (The Book of the Joyful Way, 2016, p.5)</i></p>
      <p>Every legitimate religion provides the means by which any member can directly engage the Golden Dialetik, but when you ready to take the next step, you are looking to engage infinity; you will be going beyond the limits of any Crystal Choice, and your current Crystal Choice will fill you with expectations that can be your last barrier to experiencing the Golden Dialetik.</p>
      <p>This does not mean you have to give up Christianity or Buddhism or Islam; just that you must have faith that your Crystal Choice will come through this process and come back to your cherished Crystal Choice new eyes and new perspectives.  This is the true meaning of faith. </p>
      <p>You may or may not be a Christian or Buddhist or Muslim after your experiences, but, if you return and resume your previous Crystal Choice, the depth of your understanding will dimensionally increase within the confines of your Crystal Choice.  Although you may resume worshipping your familiar version of the One (God, Allah, etc.), the truly wise are awakened that their current Crystal Choice has subtly changed, and is not the same as their original choice, even if their visible version of the One appears to be the same as before. </p>
      <p>Regardless of your selection, everyone should venerate the path that has gotten them where they have gotten to, even if they have been guided into new pathways.</p>
