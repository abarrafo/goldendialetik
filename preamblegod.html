        <p>Before approaching the concepts of God or the existence thereof, three issues must be discussed:  (1) An honest appraisal of “belief in God,” as a concept, (2) the new perspective from which to perceive God from, and (3) the axioms necessary to support this change in perspective.  This approach to the concept of God is not predicated on any holy book or prophets words, nor the contortions of philosophy, but it is predicated that there is a metaphysical reality, the Golden Dialetik, that is a recognizable alternative reality which everyone can accept.  In the end, my hope is that anyone can put aside the “belief in God” and embrace the concept in the “knowledge that God exists,” if this is the Crystal Choice you should choose.</p>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p></p>
        <p><i>"By understanding the Golden Dialetik, one can now understand the medium within which God exists and works.  This uncovers the frailty of 'belief.'   By stating that one 'believes' in God, actually implies that this person has doubts into the existence of the Primordial Synthesis, the phase of the Golden Dialetik people normally associate with God.  When one doubts about the presence of a thing or concept, belief is needed to pretend that an object or entity exists.  The reality is when someone says ‘I believe in God,’ they are really saying ‘I doubt that God exists, but I pretend He does.’"  (The Golden Dialetik, 2014, p.123)</i></p>
        <p>In this day and age, belief is no longer an acceptable option when it comes to God, but there is an understanding of reality in which there is no question that God does exist.  This requires accepting the concepts of The Golden Dialetik.  I’m not saying that “belief” is completely useless, but in regards to the concept of God, the knowledge that God exists is far better than wishing so.</p>
        <p>This conflict with belief and humanity’s quest for knowledge is not new.  People attempting to look at the universe from a scientific perspective have been harassed, and in some cases, killed by religious zealots.  Now that this is no longer appropriate behavior, science is viewed as chipping away at religion, making the firmly religious insecure, but the biggest assault is upon understanding the concept of “God.”  People are moving away from rationality and clinging to “beliefs” desperately, but one of the outcomes of this study is that this is no longer necessary.</p>
        <p>As long as one can understand that the existence in God is not predicated on “belief,” the biggest question is resolved, but this does require changing some basic premises, which leads to the need to expand your perspective to be able to fit in this new vision of “God.”</p>
        <h3>Belief in God?</h3>
        <p></p>
        <p>The basic precepts required are an acceptance of the existence of the Golden Dialetik, and that this Golden Dialetik, the nexus between physics (reality) and metaphysics, has been and can be experienced, from which Crystal Choices are derived.</p>
        <p><i>"Every type of choice has equal value, whether it is God(s) or atheism.  All individuals are looking at the same reality, the Golden Dialetik and seeing it in different ways.  Even the differences in names for this phenomenon (God, Allah, Jehovah, Nihilism, Nothingness, Tao, the One, etc.) are equal in the context of the Golden Dialetik.  Habitually, there has been a great deal of hostility across this intellectual frontier.  Lack of understanding that these various choices arise out of a common source have led to much misery, but by providing a unified theory all can live in equanimity together, if they so choose."  (The Golden Dialetik, 2014, p.31-32)</i></p>
        <p>This may be threatening to some, but this approach is simply an extension of the ancient story of the blind men and the elephant.  As the Sufi version goes, there was a city of blind people, and when a king arrived with an army, including an elephant, this visit caused a high level of curiosity, especially in regards to the elephant.  Several of the blind went willy-nilly to find this elephant and learn about this creature.  Upon their return, they were asked by the rest of the population to describe this magnificent beast.  Each blind person who had touched the elephant took their turn describing it.  The one who touched its ear, explained the creature was like a rough rug; the one who touched its trunk felt a hollow pipe that could be dangerous in battle (Jain – tree branch); the one that touched its leg described a mighty pillar; from the Jain version the one that felt the tale pronounced the creature as a rope; the one that felt the belly said it was like a wall; and the one that felt the tusk felt a pipe.</p>   
        <p>The moral of the story was that each felt a piece, but all were parts of the same animal.  Crystal Choices touch the same phenomena (the Golden Dialetik) and come away with differing experiences, and only by realizing this phenomenon and rising above one’s own Crystal Choice and accepting all can the whole elephant be experienced.</p>
        <p><i>"People have to transcend the human condition, if they truly want to understand the One.  If you believe in God, all these conditions, the One, God, Tao, intelligent and mechanical design, even atheism (Nothingness), are snapped images of a single source, or as  I call these snapshots, Crystal Choices, and to see the whole picture, the challenge is to embrace all these visions…  All are true visions; the problem is that humanity’s ability to accept this larger reality is very limited."  (The Book of the Joyful Way, 2016, p.5)</i></p>
        <p>If you believe in God(s), you need to embrace this wide-ranging concept, because God in his omniscience not only does do so, but obviously created this diversity in experiences.  This leads to the “great irony.</p>
        <p><i>"Knowing that God attended to with sublime moderation leads to moving beyond the face of God to the heart of God, God becomes no longer recognizable...  In essence, this evolution is the ironical phenomenon whereby you have to leave God behind to find God, leave the Tao behind to find the Tao." (The Golden Dialetik, 2014, p.8)</i></p>
        <p>God has an infinite number of faces.  To commune with God requires going beyond the face and experiencing the substance.  This is risky and daunting for those afraid that their prophet could be exposed.  There is no doubt that what you perceive will not fit perfectly with everything your prophet has espoused, but on the whole the best prophets will fare very well after you pass through this experience.</p>
<p>This is a good segue to the next section:  the axioms.</p>
        <h3>Axioms of the Golden Dialetik</h3>
 
        <p></p>
        <p>From this study of the Golden Dialetik, the metaphysical reality, and normal reality, three immutable truths arise:</p>
        <p><i>
        •	"The Golden Dialetik is perfect and is the one point of perfection in the universe<br>
        •	The universe was made imperfect <br>
        •	Although the dialectical structure permeates the Dialetik and the Golden Dialetik at all levels, the basic structure is unchanging in form.  In essence, the Golden Dialetik never changes, but is the source of all change."  (The Golden Dialetik, p.28-29)</i></p>

<p>For millennia, belief in reality as being a reflection of the perfection of God has pervaded many religious belief systems, and paradoxically, there is some truth to this adage.  As long as one focuses on the parallel metaphysical reality, the Golden Dialetik is perfect.  The dialectical structure remains the same in all instances of reality, and in theory the “synthesis” in each dialectical cycle is a reflection of the Primordial Synthesis.  Whether the outcome of this dialectical event is good or bad does not take away from the perfection of the dialectical structure, but shows the imperfection of the inherent elements cycling through the dialectical structure at that time.</p>
<p><i>"Hearkening back to the Bible, God is a “jealous God” (Bible, Exodus 20, stated within the 10 Commandments) and the one thing He retained was His state of perfection."  (The Golden Dialetik, 2014, p.8)</i></p>
<p>Per the Bible, God has reserved this state of perfection for his metaphysical realm, but not for the reality we know.</p>
<p>For the “God’s Universe is Perfect” people (GUPs), the evidence of this imperfection of reality abounds, and rationalizations for why this imperfection exists from the Judeo-Christian-Abrahamic (Muslim) religions center on the concept of sin.   Oddly, I agree with this, but the definition of sin requires a complete revision:</p>
<p><i>"Ironically, I agree with the assessment that “human sin” will contribute to the end of humanity, but not in the normal Biblical way.  Sin could be defined as “surrendering to the distractions of life,” whether they be providing for a family or succumbing to a less desirable life-style as pronounced in the Bible.  The distractions caused by humanity’s basic needs (food, shelter, sex, etc.) pull people away from understanding the Middle Way and eventually the Golden Dialetik."  (The Golden Dialetik, 2014, p.57)</i></p>
<p>Biblical sin centers on preventing catastrophes.  In this ancient culture this focused on preventing life-styles that do not support the growth of the population, such as homosexuality, or do not support social stability as adultery, both being branded with associations with debauchery (associations, not necessarily earned).  In the context of this ancient society, either not desiring to bring forth off-spring (homosexuality) or being a disruptive force among the people (adultery), these practices would be viewed by the culture as dangerous to the survival of the society.  Hence, in this olden day and age, these “sins” would have been very recognizable as needed to prevent the catastrophe of having the culture conquered and/or destroyed, but these ancient “sins” really limited the full breadth of the concept of sin.</p>
<p><i>"True sin is a society’s inability to accumulate enough knowledge to identify and avert … catastrophes, and a person resisting the seeking of truth."  (The Golden Dialetik, 2014, p.161-162)</i></p>
<p>In today’s society a “true sin” is a scientist lying for financial reasons, a prime example being scientists fabricating slanted analysis of global warming in support oil interests, even though the knowledge that global warming is a self-evident and scientifically supported truth, threatening the future existence of millions of people.  These reports are leading people away from the truth, and blindly towards a potential catastrophe.  This is a far greater sin than one’s sexual preferences, especially in a world where over-population is becoming a concern.</p>
<p>This review of biblical sin provides a reason for the existence of imperfection in the reality that we know, but the conclusion is that reality is not perfect, and even the Bible acknowledges this, or else sin would not exist.</p>
<p>The third axiom covers the phenomena that the process throughout this metaphysical realm is the same.  Whether at the dialectic, dialetik, Dialetik or Golden Dialetik levels, although the scope is different, the dialectical structure ALWAYS remains the same, even going back to creation. In a universe of change, this is changeless and eternal.  Where every creature on Earth cannot escape from the ravages of time, the Golden Dialetik appears to be immune and timeless.</p>
