      <p>Upon my meager review of Atheism, I have found that atheists are very individualistic.  The reason for someone’s theoretical foundations in atheism boil down to 3 points:</p>
      1)	Disbelief in the existence of God(s)<br>
      2)	Belief in Nothingness<br>
      3)	Belief that there is no “intelligence” behind this Nothingness<br>
      <p></p>
<p>These are in ways disparate considerations, and atheists may partake in all of them, or distill down to just the 1st mandate, the disbelief in the existence of God(s).  As atheists themselves will note, this is a two-dimensional structure with no underlying philosophy, since each individual supposedly fills in the third-dimension with their own personal philosophical perambulations.</p>
<p>In theory, atheists scrutinize the same reality, the same Golden Dialetik, as everyone else.   Their implied perception is that this brings forth a state of Nothingness.  This is far from being a pejorative.  Within the mythic realm, the concept of Nothingness has a vaunted past, being described over and over.  A synthesis distilled from mythological roots describes Nothingness as:</p>
<p><i>"Nothingness is desolate and vast, but also silent and serene.  In the darkness, Nothingness is a flowing plasma, but without form, timeless.  This insubstantial matter is ceaselessly circulating, but creates no wind or sound or smell.  Action without order, this is Chaos, but this Chaos is formless and flawless.  Expanding and contracting, Nothingness is immaculately pregnant, filled with nothing and everything, but beyond all else, Nothingness is Perfect."  (The Golden Dialetik, 2014, p.96)</i></p>
<p>Nothingness is the universe in a state of sublime Chaos.  This in essence is a rich and powerful expression of reality, an understanding of the universe that can be understood, but without any distractions.  This presents a parsimonious view of reality, whereby this Nothingness can be understood only by virtue of an unfettered view.  This is the stripped down perspective of a “true scientist,” arising as the most compatible perspective of an atheist.</p>
<p><i>"Without really knowing it, all scientists are seeking the Golden Dialetik.  Achieving the state of mind required to be a scientist is akin to Buddha’s methods of meditation to strip away one’s “self” to understand “no-self”.  Under this state of mind a scientist follows a hypothesis back by removing distracting influences as part of the process of experimentation and testing with the hope that the hypothesis will reveal more truth, until a relatively absolute truth is arrived at as the scientist gets closer to the source of truth.  Part of these “distractions” are the removal of the scientist’s expectations, especially including the veil of their Crystal Choice. The perfect scientist is a man or woman who has achieved the state of Nibbana and partakes of this transcendent objectivity." (The Golden Dialetik, 2014, p.61)</i></p>
<p>There is no “God” or “Gods” in this perspective, distracting this perception away from reality.  There is just a direct interface with reality, which in this manifestation can be called Nothingness or, as I refer to it, a Crystal Choice, or vision of the Golden Dialetik.  The atheist may call it reality.</p>
<p>Following this line of thought to a deeper level, there is an acceptance that an order exists (one cannot get away from the fact that scientists like Newton and Einstein were seeking and continue to seek a deeper order; this is a basic principle of science and the scientific method), but there is not necessarily an intelligence lurking behind this order.  There is an interesting purity to this consideration.  Please bear with me through this quotation:</p>
<p><i>"Knowing that God, attended to with sublime moderation, leads to moving beyond the face of God to the heart of God, God becomes no longer recognizable...  In essence, this evolution is the ironical phenomenon whereby you have to leave God behind to find God, leave the Tao behind to find the Tao." (The Book of the Joyful Way, 2016, p.28)</i></p>
<p>If one wishes to engage the Golden Dialetik, all prejudicial distractions need to be put aside, even the belief in the intelligence of God.  The idea that one has to “leave God behind to find God” for the purpose of engaging the Golden Dialetik exposes a point in time when everyone would be technically an atheist. This demonstrates that atheism is a natural component in the quest to engage the Golden Dialetik, whether the outcome is belief in God or no God at all (Nothingness).  </p> 
<p>Atheism can be a very clear and responsible Crystal Choice, assuming that the adherent is committed to “sublime moderation.”  Anarchistic atheists may put aside moderation, but these people represent this faction’s extremists; the vast majority of atheists just wish to live and love within the normal constraints of moderation, but without a perceived, acceptable moral guidance for the atheists by the atheists, the greatest danger to the atheistic assemblage is that one violent, nihilistic person, identified as an atheist, can negatively influence the perception to the world of the whole movement.</p>
